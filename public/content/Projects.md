## Memory Game
I harnessed React's magic and the useRef hook to craft an entertaining memory game 🧠🎮. Players flip cards to unveil pairs, honing memory and focus skills while having a blast! 🃏✨ I nailed seamless card flipping using useRef. Cards shuffle every start, guaranteeing a fresh, unexpected challenge. 🎰 Logic detects matching symbols, awarding points on success, enhancing engagement. 🎯 With a scoreboard for rivalry and a timer to heat things up, the game gains intensity. The project spotlighted my React expertise and deepened my useRef prowess. Kudos to the React community, and big thanks to open-source champs and tutorials 🙌📚.
